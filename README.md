# Visual Sorter

Ranging from simple to complex, sorting algorithms can be hard to grasp, and as a visual learner, I believe complex topics are best understood when demonstrated visually. To address this exact problem, I built Visual Sorter. Visual Sorter is an application that provides a real-time, interactive representation of various sorting algorithms applied to randomly generated arrays.

# Currently supported sorting algorithms
- Merge Sort (O(nlog(n)))
- Quick Sort (O(nlog(n)))
- Heap Sort (O(nlog(n)))
- Selection Sort (O(n²))
- Insertion Sort (O(n²))
- Bubble Sort (O(n²))
